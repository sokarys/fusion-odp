Here’s a set of basic demos to get you started with SMIL-Timing.

<http://wam.inrialpes.fr/timesheets/public/demo/>

> Here’s the home page slideshow. Not the simplest example, though.

<http://wam.inrialpes.fr/timesheets/public/demo/video>

> SMIL-Timing can easily be used to add HTML subtitles to a video stream. This
> has been applied to the Mozilla Firefox 4 beta “[first
> run](http://www.mozilla.com/fr/firefox/4.0b1/firstrun/)” page…

<http://wam.inrialpes.fr/timesheets/public/demo/audio>

> Here is a SMIL/Timing adaptation of [this HTML5/Audio
> demo](http://apm.ircam.fr/page/audio-tag/) (proposed by Samuel Goldszmidt,
> IRCAM) — but the HTML content is _synchronized with the audio track_, which
> is precisely the goal of our project.

<http://wam.inrialpes.fr/timesheets/public/demo/slideshow>

> A quick slideshow designed with declarative, inline SMIL-Timing markup.
> This demo shows how to get most of the common slideshow effects (transitions,
> incremental display, outlining…) with SMIL-Timing.
